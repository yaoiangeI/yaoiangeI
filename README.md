## BYI / BYF ‧˚₊꒷꒦︶︶︶︶︶꒷꒦︶︶︶︶︶꒦꒷‧₊˚⊹
- calling other queer people invalid is internalized queerphobia i fear. if you disagree with that you're just in denial. get a life and stop harrassing your fellow queers. harass homophobes instead.
- I'm annoying as hell!! 
- I'm 14 so keep in mind what you say too me ^^'
- Very possible that I will get mad by anyone who likes my interests (I don't know why I do this IM SORRY)
- I'm #woke
- I rarely respond to whispers.. unless it's something important anxiety will eat me alive gulp
- I'm always tired and I WONT!! stop complaining about it.
